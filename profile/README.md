# AgriHUB: AI and Earth Observation for Sustainable Ecosystems

##  What we do

AgriHUB is a research group within the Beyond Center of Earth Observation Research of the National Observatory of Athens.  We conduct research in the domain of Big Earth data and Artificial Intelligence trying to understand agro-ecosystems and develop applications that support sustainable and resilient agriculture. Over the last five years, our team has participated in more than ten EU-funded projects providing agricultural information services that utilize satellite data, drone images, street-level images, geotagged photos from the field and numerical weather predictions to address real-world problems in the thematic areas described at the end of this paragraph. 

Through this work, AgriHUB has developed the following novel applications: agrowth (phenology and yield predictions), resagri (weather peril earth warning system), optimal sowing recommendation system (with Corteva) and DataCAP (policy monitoring system). These applications are product of systematic research that has culminated to several scientific publications: crop classification using satellite data and machine learning [1-4], semi-supervised and unsupervised phenology predictions for real-world scenarios [5, 6], prediction of the onset of pest harmfulness in cotton [5], fusion of satellite and street-level images for enhanced agricultural monitoring [6], agriculture monitoring data cubes to handle the massive amounts of satellite data [7-8], large scale food security monitoring using high performance computers [9-10], land suitability for applying specific management practices using causal machine learning [11] and assessment of the impact of digital agriculture tools using causal inference (soon public).
